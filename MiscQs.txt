1. Find the intersection of 2 linked lists (for ex a->b->c-d, m->b->c->d, b 
is the intersection point.
Sol: a) Use hash table (or mark visited nodes)
     b) http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/archives/2405
     
2. Find and REMOVE a loop in a linked list (also proof of why it works. 'k' be size of loop. 'n' be distance b/n slow and fast. relative speed is 1. 
so it takes k-n steps for them to meet)
Sol: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5607292/interview-remove-loop-in-linked-list-java

3. Merge Sort using Linked List .. Write Java code for this.
Sol: http://www.careercup.com/question?id=11208726

4. Find middle, 1/3rd, 2/3rd nodes in a LL.
Sol: a) Calculate length of LL in first traversal, and then traverse 2nd time to get the required elements
     b) Use 3 pointers, a->next,b->next->next,c->next->next->next.
     c) Copy to an array :)
     
5. Find 2nd and 3rd largest elements of an array in a single pass.
Sol: a) use additional variables
     b) if not a single pass, try Algorithm course method (randomized/deterministic)
     
6. Merge 2 sorted Lists. 
Sol: a) Similar to array merge but without using extra memory
     b) Recursive Solution (http://www.careercup.com/question?id=9208580)
     
7. Duplicate Element in a LinkedList/Array

8. There is a linked list of numbers of length N. N is very large and you don't know N. 
You have to write a function that will return k random numbers from the list. 
Numbers should be completely random.
Sol: Reservoir Sampling Algorithm

9. find the maximum subsequence sum in a linked list. Consider the node as shown below.
This node class has a extra item isVertex which determines whether the node is a vertex r not.
so find the longest distance between any 2 vertex in the linked list.

Node SLL{
int data;
Node n;
bool isVertex;
}

10. Given a linked list with two pointers in node structure where one points to the 
next node and the other pointer points to some random node in the linked list. 
Write a program to create a copy of this linked list

11. Convert a binary search tree to a circular sorted linked list.
The highest valued node should point to the lowest valued node at each step. ??

12. Write code (in C) to convert a binary search tree into a sorted doubly linked list. 
The algorithm should use recursion and should be done in place.

13. Implement a Queue using 2 stacks and vice versa.

14. Implement a Queue using Arrays

1. Reverse Linked List using Recursion
2. Deep Reverse for a Tree
3. Change Count using Recursion
4. Solve a+b+c+... = M
5. Number of ways to split an Integer.
6. Fibonacci in O(Logn).
7. Nqueens Problem.
8. List all the subsets of a set without repetition.
9. Solve all the above problems in Java to output the actual solutions rather than just giving the number of solutions.
10. A[i] = A[j]+A[k], for j,k < i. Q 3.16 Tamassia. or Q C-4.3 (sort the array. and then can be solved in O(n))
11. Separate even and odd integers in an array. (logic similar to pivot in Quick Sort)
12. Stack to reverse an array.
13. Towers of Hanoi using Stack.
14. Permutations using 1 stack and 1 Queue.
Ans:
Initially you have the letters on the stack in reverse order, and you have an empty queue:
1. Repeatedly pop a value from the stack and enqueue it on the queue, stopping as soon
as you pop a value that comes alphabetically before the one you just enqueued. Call that
value the "pivot".
2. Repeatedly dequeue a value and enqueue it, stopping as soon as you dequeue a
value that comes alphabetically after the pivot. Push that value onto the stack.
3. Enqueue the pivot, then repeatedly dequeue a value and enqueue it, stopping as soon
as you dequeue a value that is alphabetically before the pivot. Push it onto the stack.
4. Repeatedly dequeue a value from the queue and push it on the stack until the queue
is empty

15. Round Robin Using Queue.
16. Array and Linked List Sorting using Stack/Queue.

*******Trees*************

1. Given the Pre-order of the BST .check if each non-leaf node has only one child.
   Linear Time is expected.
Soln: http://www.careercup.com/question?id=14453690

2. Convert a BST to Doubly Linked List.

Soln: Modify isBST function to pass minNode and maxNode. Try this.

3. Give the level at which the BST is Complete. Try this.

**4. InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder and Find depth of a tree without using recursion.

8. Given a binary tree, every node has a int value, return the root node of subtree 
with the largest sum up value. Java is more preferable. Caution: the return should 
be a node, not a integer!
